    <h1>Getting Started with Asynchronous Programming in .NET</h1>
    <p class="lead">This demo application should be running locally using IIS Express on <strong>http://localhost:61363</strong></p>

        <h2>Where is the data located?</h2>
        <p>
            The demos use two different files:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>CompanyData.csv</strong></li>
                <li><strong>StockPrices_Small.csv</strong></li>
            </ul>
            These files may both be used in<strong>StockAnalyzer.Web</strong> as well as <strong>StockAnalyzer.Windows</strong> depending on the demo you are following.
        </p>
        <p>These files are added as Links and copied to the output directory during compile time. It is therefore required that you keep the <strong>StockData</strong> in the root where you extract all the demos.</p>
        <p>The DataStore (<strong>DataStore.cs</strong>) takes the base path to where the files are located as a base path.</p>
        <p>This is injected from both the Web and the Windows project where applicable.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <h2>Can I change the port of StockAnalyzer.Web?</h2>
        <p>
            Yes! In order to do that, make sure that you change every reference to <strong>localhost:61363</strong>.
</p>
        <p><strong>App.xaml.cs</strong> checks that you have a service running on <strong>localhost:61363</strong>, make sure to point this to the real location you have chosen.</p>

        <h2>How do I run the demos?</h2>
        <p>You should be running both <strong>StockAnalyzer.Web</strong> as well as <strong>StockAnalyzer.Windows</strong> simultaniously. To set this up you can configure the solution to run multiple startup projects.</p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Right-click the Solution <strong>StockAnalyzer</strong> select Properties</li>
                <li>Set both <strong>StockAnalyzer.Web</strong> and <strong>StockAnalyzer.Windows</strong> to <strong>Start</strong></li>
            </ol>
